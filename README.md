# Challenge - Term 1


#### `arrayReverse`
Given an array of numbers, reverse the order of the numbers in the array.


#### `inBothArrays`
Given 2 arrays of numbers, return an array that includes all numbers that appear in both arrays.


#### `characterCount`
Given a string and then a single character `c`, write a function that will return a count equal to the number of occurences of the character `c` inside the string.


#### `numberSwap`
Given two number variables, `a` and `b`, swap the values of those two variables.  Try using only 2 variables!


#### `palindrome`
Given a string, check to see if that string is a palindrome.  A palindrome is a string that is spelled the same both frontwards and backwards (ie, `racecar`)


#### `targetSum`
Given an array of unique numbers and a target number, find all pairs of integers that can be summed in that array that will give the target number.  If there are none return `undefined`.  Return the pairs as an array of arrays.  Note: [a,b] and [b,a] can be treated as the same thing.  

```
Example
targetSum([5,1,6,8,3,9],14) => [ [6,8],[5,9] ] 
```

#### `isPrime`
Given an input number `n`, check if n is a prime number.  A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself. If the number is prime, return true and if not return false.


<!-- #### `secondLargest`
Given an unsorted array of numbers, find the second largest number in that array.   -->
